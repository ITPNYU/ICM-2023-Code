# Animation: Variables

_The videos in this section were created using a different editor for p5.js. All of the concepts should still apply, however, there are some minor changes. Most notably in JavaScript `let` is now the preferred way to declare a variable over `var`. If you would like to learn more about this you can [watch this video about let vs var](https://youtu.be/q8SHaDQdul0)._

## Video Tutorials: Basics

- `setup()`, `draw()`, and other events: `mousePressed()`, etc.
- Built-in variables
  - [2.1: Variables in p5.js (mouseX, mouseY)]https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js/code/2-variables/1-mouseX-mouseY)
- User defined variables
  - [2.2: Variables in p5.js (Define your own)]https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js/code/2-variables/2-define-variables)
- The [random()](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/random) function
  - [2.5: random()](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js/code/2-variables/4-random)
- The [map()](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/map) function
  - [2.4: map()](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js/code/2-variables/5-map)
