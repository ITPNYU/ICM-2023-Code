# Policies

## Evaluation

Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:
* Regular Assignments 40%
* Participation and Attendance 50%
* Final Project Presentation 10%

We will have weekly assignments that are relevant to material from the previous class. These assignments are required and you should be prepared to show/talk about them in class. It is expected that everyone in the class will create and maintain a blog for their assignments.

An assignment extension may be granted upon request. If you request an extension, your grade will not be affected. However, if you do not request an extension, the grading rules above apply.

Attendance is mandatory. Please inform your teacher via email if you are going to miss a class. Two unexcused absences is cause for failing the class. (An unexcused lateness of 10 minutes or more is equivalent to 1/2 an absence.)

Participation is a critical part of learning in a small seminar setting. Examples of modes of participation include: Asking and answering questions of the instructor and of each other (either in-person or online), engaging in group discussion, engaging in in-class exercises, play-testing each other's projects, showing up... on-time, active listening, taking notes. Participation counts as 50% of your grade.

Class will culminate with final projects which you will present to the class. You are expected to push your abilities to produce something that utilizes what you have learned in the class. This will comprise 10% of your grade.

You will receive a mid-term grade which will ultimately be replaced by a final grade. The 3 grade options are P(Pass), F(Fail) and I(Incomplete). Incompletes can only be granted to those who have completed more than half of their class assignments. Incompletes are given at the discretion of the instructor as managing incompletes often creates additional uncompensated labor for the instructor.

Please see ITP's statement on [Pass/Fail](http://help.itp.nyu.edu/academic-policies/pass-fail) which states that a "Pass" is equivalent to an "A" or a "B" while anything less would be considered a "Fail".

## Communication

You are responsible for checking your email (or other stated class form of communication) for important updates about class.

## Statement of Academic Integrity

Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks or from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else. In the case of code, plagiarism is to present as your own code written by someone else without attribution or citing the source of the code.

Collaboration is highly valued and often necessary to produce great work. Students build their own work on that of other people and giving credit to the creator of the work you are incorporating into your own work is an act of integrity. Plagiarism, on the other hand, is a form of fraud. Proper acknowledgment and correct citation constitute the difference.

## Statement of Principle

The core of the educational experience at the Tisch School of the Arts is the creation of original academic and artistic work by students for the critical review of faculty members.  It is therefore of the utmost importance that students at all times provide their instructors with an accurate sense of their current abilities and knowledge in order to receive appropriate constructive criticism and advice.  Any attempt to evade that essential, transparent transaction between instructor and student through plagiarism or cheating is educationally self-defeating and a grave violation of Tisch School of the Arts community standards.  For all the details on plagiarism, please refer to page 10 of the [Tisch School of the Arts, Policies and Procedures Handbook](http://students.tisch.nyu.edu/page/home.html).

## Statement on Accessibility

It’s crucial for our community to create and uphold learning environments that empower students of all abilities. We are committed to create an environment that enables open dialogue about the various temporary and long term needs of students and participants for their academic success. We encourage all students and participants to discuss with faculty and staff possible accommodations that would best support their learning.  Students may also contact the Moses Center for Student Accessibility (212-998-4980) for resources and support.

## Statement on Counseling and Wellness

Your health and safety are a priority at NYU. Emphasizing the importance of the wellness of each individual within our community, students are encouraged to utilize the resources and support services available to them 24 hours a day, 7 days a week via the NYU Wellness Exchange Hotline at 212-443-9999. Additional support is available over email at wellness.exchange@nyu.edu and within the NYU Wellness Exchange app.

## Statement on use of Electronic Devices

Laptops will be an essential part of the course and may be used in class during workshops and for taking notes in lecture. Laptops must be closed during class discussions and student presentations.  Phone use in class is strictly prohibited unless directly related to a presentation of your own work or if you are asked to do so as part of the curriculum.
